# NGOConnect
#About
Through our website, NGO Connect, we are providing a platform for people to report issues that fall under various categories that NGOs work for, and send these issues to NGOs who have registered on our website, based on the location and category of the problem that is reported. The various categories of problems that we seek to resolve through the NGOs that work to resolve those fall under the UN Goals of Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well-Being, Clean Water and Sanitation, Responsible Consumption and Production, Gender Equality and Empowerment, Quality Education. We want to achieve the UN Goal of Reduced Inequalities through our web portal, as by resolving the problems faced by these communities, we are increasing their quality of life and thereby reducing inequalities by bridging the gap that these people face due to the lack of means. We were inspired to select the above mentioned goals as we feel that these are the most pressing issues that our country is facing today, and only by solving and achieving these goals, our country will be able to progress. We feel that even the smallest amount of contribution that one makes can go a long way towards the betterment of our society. If people do as simple a thing as just report a problem they see in a locality they live in or visit, we will have NGOs and other individuals on board who would be eager to take up those problems and resolve them.
